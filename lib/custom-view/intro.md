**Welcome to the first non national citizens debate on an international agreement**

We've created this platform around these 3 goals :

+ providing a non national platform to argue, debate and vote on international agreements and become more sensitive about the institutional responses to climate change.
+ promoting a collective reading of the COP21 Negotiating Draft and bring it closer to the pluralities of our everyday lives.
+ sharing the experience with the other DemocracyOS users because sometimes the content may be as Open Source as the code.
